    <h1>Text Formatting Tags</h1>
    <p>There are different text formatting tags we can use in HTML.
        Like the <b>BOLD (b)</b> tag and the <I>Italic (I)</I> tag for font.
        We use the <em>Emphasis(em)</em> tag for emphasis.
        There is also the <q>Quote(q)</q> tag for quotes like <q>An apple a day keeps the doctor away.</q>
        If we have brought section from another source than we use the Blockquote(blockquote) tag.
        For example:<blockquote https://worldalpinetreks.com/laliguras-national-flower-nepal>The Laliguras flower, also known as the Rhododendron flower, proudly represents Nepal as its national flower.</blockquote>
        Then there is the Deleted(del) tag which strikethrough the text often accompanied by Inserted(ins) tag.
        Like:The banquet is at <del>6:00pm</del> <ins>7:00pm</ins>
